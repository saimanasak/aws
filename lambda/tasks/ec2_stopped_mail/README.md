### Task Overview:
- Launching an EC2 instance using Azure DevOps pipeline.
- Whenever the launched instance goes down, stopped, or terminated, a lambda function is triggered and sends an email to the respective team.
- This is implemented using AWS services like Lambda Functions, EC2 Instances, CloudWatch Rules, and SNS (Simple Notification Service)
